# Paramita

Compiler Construction Project - Spring 2024. Implementing a simple compiler for a Java-like object-oriented language.

## Key features

- **Control flow support:** Including if statements and for loops.
- **Namespaces:** Grouping objects, functions and classes inside of a namespace.
- **Functions:** Global functions and class methods are both implemented.
- **Classes and inheritance:** Both members and methods are inherited.
- **Static members and initializers:** Currently, static methods are not supported.

## Dependencies

- ant
- JDK 1.8 or newer

## Usage

The lexer and the parser classes must first be generated by JFlex and CUP respectively. To do this run:
```bash
ant lexerGen
ant parserGen
```

To run the compiler:
```bash
ant compiler-run -Dcsrc=<path-to-source-code> -Dcout=<path-to-object-file>
```

To start your program, run the following command:

```bash
ant mjvm-run -Dmjin=<path-to-object-file>
```

Finally, if you wish to see the bytecode disassembly of your compiled code, input the following:

```bash
ant disasm -Dmjin=<path-to-object-file>
```

To clean the project:
```bash
ant clean
```

Note that the clean command deletes the classes created by the JFlex and CUP libraries and they need to be generated again.

## Examles and tests

The test directory contains four simple example programs.
